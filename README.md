This application allows the user to calculate their body mass index, or BMI.  
# How-To-Use  
Height and Weight must be entered in their respective text fields, and a metrix units switch can be toggled to indicate whether the height and weight fields are imperial or metric. Pressing return in the height box switches the user to editing the weight box, and pressing return in the weight box (or the calculate button below) calculates and displays the BMI. The "Calculate Healthy Weight" button calculates what weight a person should aim to be, for their height, in order to have a healthy BMI.
